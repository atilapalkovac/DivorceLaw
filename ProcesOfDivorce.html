                        What happens between the time you first meet with your lawyer until your divorce is finally completed?  Why do some divorces take years, while others are resolved in a matter of weeks?  How hard is it to get a divorce, anyway?

                    <p>
                        In our other Ultimate Guides, we have talked about what the law is, and how judges apply it.  In this Guide, we want to talk about process;  that is, the mechanics of how cases are resolved, from start to finish.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To make this Guide easier to navigate, we’ve broken out chapters that deserve their own, smaller Guides.  We’ll talk about each of these topics below in a cursory way, so that you can see how all of the gears in the machine work together.  But if you want to go into the fine details, you can explore these separate guides:

                        We’re going to work through the things that often happen in divorce cases, but don’t think that means that they’re likely to happen in your divorce case.  No, in this case we’re strictly talking worst case scenario here.  Something like 80% of people getting a divorce do so by agreement.  That means they get it done in less than 100 days, and the legal fees are minimal — certainly in comparison to high-conflict divorces.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Why are some cases resolved so quickly, while others take forever?
                    </p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">THE 8.05 FINANCIAL DECLARATION</p>
                    <p>
                        Early in the process, perhaps even when you retain your lawyer, he will give you a 10-page financial declaration to complete.  This is your 8.05, named after Uniform Chancery Court Rule 8.05, which makes submission of the form mandatory in divorce and other cases involving child support.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unless both parties agree (and the judge) agree to waive submission of the 8.05, it is mandatory.  Many judges categorically refuse to waive 8.05’s.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can find a <a href="Secured/LegalFormDeafult.aspx">sample form 8.05 HERE.</a>

                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Importance of the 8.05</p>
                    <p>
                        In a moment we will review the 8.05 form, but first let’s think about its role in your case.  It is a pain to complete, and some of the information required is irrelevant.  Many parties think of the 8.05 as a chore (which it is) and a meaningless technical requirement (which it is not).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you have read our <a href="DividingAssets.html">Ultimate Guide to Dividing Assets in Divorce.</a>, you have already seen that all of the assets have to be listed and valued.  The 8.05 is where you provide your schedule of assets and debts.  Our <a href="Alimony.html">Guide on Alimony</a>Guide on Alimony explains that, in considering an award of alimony, the Court compares your income and expenses with your spouse’s.  The 8.05 is where you list your income and expenses.  If you have read our <a href="DividingAssets.html">Guide to Child Support</a>, you have seen that the children’s expenses, and their parents’ relative ability to pay those expenses, is central to an award of child support.  The 8.05 is where you list the children’s expenses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Suffice it to say that the 8.05 is the Grand Central Station of all of the financial decisions that will be made in your case.  All of the financial trains run in and out of this form.  It must be built right.  The quality of a judge’s decision is in direct correlation to the quality of information provided.  The judge can’t base his ruling on your financial reality if you haven’t shown him what that reality is.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The 8.05 not only supplies information in your case, but credibility.  This form may be the first impression that you make on the judge.  We have seen parties (not our clients!) sitting on benches in courthouse hallways, scribbling away on their 8.05 just a few minutes before their hearing begins.
                        A last-minute, slapdash approach undermines your credibility before you ever say a word.
                        Think about it — if you were a judge, which would carry more weight with you?  An organized, typed document with supporting schedules, tax returns, etc., or a hand-scrawled, incomplete form, with numbers that don’t add up and key fields left blank?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pain though it is (and it is a pain), completing the 8.05 with accurate information is probably your most important project in the case.  Fortunately, you will not have to complete it alone.  Lawyers typically give the client a blank 8.05 with basic instructions on how to complete it, and advise them to do the best they can with it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The important part is that you actually do the best you can with it, and soon.  You might have a temporary hearing coming up, and you need to complete this form ASAP.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once you’ve done your best, sit down with your lawyer and review it carefully.  At a minimum, all of the numbers should be consistent.  By “consistent,” we mean both internal consistence (that is, values for the same item should be the same everywhere that you list that item in the 8.05), and external consistence (the values that you list should be the same as those listed on external documents, such as tax returns, pay stubs, bank statements).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We’ll talk about consistency in more detail, below.  The points here are that, first, it takes a fair amount of attention to detail to complete the 8.05 properly;  second, you will need your lawyer’s help, just as he will need yours;  third, the earlier that you get started, the better you will do;  and fourth, done well, an 8.05 adds enormous value to your case.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But yes, it is a pain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="images/processdivorce-2.jpeg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                    </p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">8.05 Page One — The Preliminaries</p>
                    <p>
                        There’s not much to the first page.  List your name, and address (typically the same address used in your complaint for divorce) and what you do for a living.  If you are unemployed, say so.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yes, you do have to list your date of birth.  No, you don’t have to list your social security number.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under the section for children, it’s a good idea to list the children of the relationship before the Court, and then the children from other/prior relationships.  It’s not a bad idea to list adult children if you are providing financial support (or are asking the judge to order the other party to do so), but you want your 8.05 to be quite clear as to which children are and are not the subject of this lawsuit.
                    </p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">8.05 Page Two — Your Income</p>
                    <p>
                        Page 2 of the 8.05 form is where you list your income.  It is divided into 2 boxes.  The box on the top lists income from all sources.  The box on the bottom lists deductions from that income.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note that the 8.05 reports income and expenses per month.  If you are paid weekly, twice a month, or anything else other than monthly, you or your lawyer will have to convert your paycheck into a monthly amount.  Pro Tip:  if you are paid weekly, your income will be under-reported if you merely multiply your weekly income by 4.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The form is written with the wage earner in mind.  The top box is where you list your gross pay, that is, before taxes and other deductions.  If you receive other income, such as rental income, or income from a business, retirement, social security, or any other source, list that in the top box, too.  The last line of the top box is where you list the total amount of all of your income from all sources, before deductions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What about income that you receive sometimes, but not always, such as overtime and bonuses?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is a conundrum, since if you list it as if you receive it every pay period, your income will be overstated, while if you leave it out, your income will be understated.  You will want to discuss this issue with your lawyer, but as a general rule it is a bad idea to say nothing at all about irregular income.  When in doubt, provide information as to what it is, how and when your employer pays irregular income (and why), how much you have received in the past, and what you expect to receive going forward.  If you think that this income should be excluded, explain why.  The judge may not agree with you, but you will retain more credibility than if you pretended that the irregular income did not exist.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        List in the bottom box your deductions from gross pay, such as withholding for federal and state taxes, FICA, insurance, loan repayments and so forth.  The bottom line of the bottom box will often be the same number as your net pay, but not always.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is because there are two ways to list deductions, and either method is valid.  The first method is to list the actual deductions from your paycheck.  The second method is to list only those deductions which the law allows you to take before child support is awarded.  For example, your employer might deduct health insurance premiums, 401(k) contributions, and loan repayments. There is nothing illegal or improper about these deductions, but they are disallowed for purposes of calculating your child support.  Your lawyer will tell you which of these two methods to use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Again, remember that the 8.05 reports monthly figures.  So if you are not paid on a per-month basis, you or your lawyer will have to convert the income and deductions listed on your paycheck to monthly amounts.

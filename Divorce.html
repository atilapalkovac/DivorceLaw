                    <p> In Mississippi, there are 3 ways to get a divorce:</p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-forward mr-3">
                        Parties can agree to all of their issues — how assets will be divided, whether alimony will be awarded, child custody and child support — and then get a
                        no-fault (“Irreconcilable Differences”) divorce.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-forward mr-3">
                        Parties can agree to get a no-fault divorce, but ask the Judge to decide any issues that they cannot resolve themselves.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-forward mr-3">
                        One party can prove that he is entitled to a divorce on a fault ground.
                    </p>
                    <p>Each of these 3 ways to get a divorce are discussed below.</p>



                    <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">THE MISSISSIPPI RULE FOR GETTING A DIVORCE</h2>
                    <p>Mississippi is unusual among the 50 states because it requires parties to agree upon a no-fault divorce.  The overwhelming majority rule in the United States is that if a spouse wants a divorce, he can have one, no questions asked, and without the other spouse’s consent. </p>
                    <p>This simply is not the case in Mississippi.  [South Dakota is the only other state that follows the same rule as Mississippi.] To get a divorce without the other spouse’s written consent, one must convince the judge that the other spouse is guilty of a fault ground, discussed below. </p>
                    <p>
                        The consequence of this rule is that, if the other spouse is (a) not guilty of a fault ground, and
                        (b) refuses to agree to a no-fault divorce, not only will a divorce not be granted, but neither will the remedies that flow from divorce:  property division and alimony.  This cannot be stressed enough.
                        If there is no divorce, there will be no property division and no alimony. Some judges carry this rule even further, and say that there will also be no award of child custody, visitation or child support, even if the spouses/parents are separated.
                    </p>

                        NO-FAULT DIVORCE
                        (“IRRECONCILABLE DIFFERENCES”)
                    </h2>
                    <p>The vast majority of divorces are resolved at the outset, when husband and wife sit down at the kitchen table and write out the bullet points of what they want their divorce to look like.  Who gets what, who will pay what, how they’re going to share the responsibilities of, and time with their children.  Then they take that agreement/outline to a lawyer, to draw up the papers and make their agreement “legal.”  We estimate that at least 80% of divorces start and end that way.</p>
                    <p>When that happens, part of the paperwork that the lawyer drafts is the agreement to an Irreconcilable Divorce.  Charting the division of assets and resolution of children’s issues might be complicated, even if the parties ostensibly have an agreement, but there’s nothing at all complicated about an Irreconcilable Differences divorce when both parties agree to it.</p>
                    <p>A word of caution:  Don’t order the online divorce papers and try to draft your legal documents yourself.  Sure, you’ll save money at the time of divorce.  But you will lose money getting a lawyer to straighten out the mess — as you surely will do, the first time that you and your ex- get into any disagreement.  We cannot count how many times that we’ve had to tell clients that their divorce papers didn't say what they thought they said.  Or worse, that the papers said something that they didn’t realize.  Lawyers make far more money fixing “messed-up papers” than they do handling the divorce the right way from the start.</p>
                    <p>
                        You don’t try to fix your car’s transmission.  You don’t try to fix the faulty wiring in your house
                        (we hope). Get a professional to handle your divorce the right way.

                        HOW A NO-FAULT DIVORCE WORKS
                    </h2>
                    <p>We won’t advise you on what arrangements you want to make with your spouse about what your divorce should look like.  Our experience is that just because people are divorcing, that doesn’t necessarily mean that they distrust each other.  Particularly if you don’t trust your spouse to be on the up-and-up, it’s a good idea to talk through your options with a lawyer before you commit to anything.  Even if you do trust your spouse, it’s not a bad idea to have a 30-60 minute sit-down with a lawyer, just to answer any questions you have, to point out any warning signs, and (if nothing else) to give you peace of mind. </p>
                    <p>It’s not enough to look around on the internet for information.  Podcasts and websites (like this one) are no substitute for the advice of an experienced lawyer advising you on your specific situation.</p>
                    <p>OK, let’s say that you’re at the point where you’ve worked out everything with your spouse, and now you’re ready to make it all “legal.”  This is the point where you definitely need to sit down with a lawyer.  Do not sign anything without talking it over with your lawyer.</p>
                    <p>Your lawyer will draw up at least 3 documents:</p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-forward mr-3">
                        The Joint Petition for Divorce, in which you and your spouse formally ask the Court to grant you a divorce, and to approve your Divorce Agreement.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-forward mr-3">
                        The Divorce Agreement, which is the contract that sets out how property and debt will be divided; how alimony (if any) will be awarded; what the child custody and visitation will be; how the financial responsibilities for the children will be divided;  and other miscellaneous provisions, such as restoring the wife’s maiden name.  [See our <a href="DividingAssets.html">Ultimate Guides to Dividing Assets in Divorce, to Alimony, to Child Custody and Visitation, and to Child Support.]
</p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-forward mr-3">
                        The Final Judgment of Divorce, which is the only document that the judge will sign.  This is the document that transforms your Divorce Agreement from a mere contract into an enforceable judgment of the court.  You are not divorced until the judge signs the Final Judgment.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">
                        The 60-Day Waiting Period
                    </h2>
                    <p>Judges aren’t allowed to approve a Final Judgment of Divorce based on Irreconcilable Differences until the Joint Petition for Divorce has been on file at the courthouse for at least 60 days.  Why not?  </p>
                    <p>The idea is to provide spouses with a “cooling off period” between the time they petition for divorce, and the time that the divorce is entered.  You are absolutely allowed to withdraw your consent to a no-fault divorce at any time before the Final Judgment is entered, and you do not need to have a good reason to do it.  You don’t need any reason at all. The only thing you need to do is to file a document with the court that simply says that you withdraw your consent to the no-fault divorce.  Doing this doesn’t necessarily stop the divorce, but it keeps the judge from signing the Final Judgment.</p>
                    <p>Can you withdraw your withdrawal (i.e., re-agree to a no-fault divorce after you’ve withdrawn your consent)? Yes.  There’s nothing unusual about spouses going back and forth in their own minds as to whether to agree to a divorce.  What matters is, when the judge signs the Final Judgment, did the parties agree to a divorce at the moment that the judge signed the papers — whether they went back and forth leading up to that moment is immaterial.</p>
                    <p>A far trickier question is whether the Divorce Agreement that you signed is still binding even after you withdraw your consent to a no-fault divorce.  To answer this question you will need to discuss the specifics of your situation with your lawyer.</p>

                        NO-FAULT DIVORCE TRIAL
                    </h2>
                    <p>What if you and your spouse agree that you should get a no-fault divorce, but can’t agree on how to divide property, or what form of custody should be awarded?  The law allows you to stipulate to the no-fault divorce, and to all of the agreements that you have been able to reach, but to have a trial so that the judge can decide all of the issues that you have not been able to agree upon.</p>
                    <p>This process requires you to sign an agreement which provides that you have agreed to the no-fault divorce, and anything else that you have agreed upon.  The agreement also lists the issues that you have been unable to agree upon, and which you want the judge to decide.  Unlike the true no-fault divorce described above, once you have signed this agreement, you are far less able to withdraw your consent to the no-fault divorce.</p>
                    <p>As to the issues that you were unable to agree upon, these will be tried before the judge like any other trial, and the judge’s decision will be final and binding — even if you completely disagree with it.  This is the risk that you take;  by agreeing to let the judge make the decision(s), you are stuck with whatever the judge decides.</p>
                    <p>Your agreement and the judge’s decision will be written into a binding, final judgment of divorce on the basis of Irreconcilable Differences.  The divorce is final once the judge signs this document.</p>

                        FAULT-BASED DIVORCE
                    </h2>
                    <p>If the parties cannot agree even to get a no-fault divorce, then they cannot get a divorce, unless one spouse can prove “fault grounds” against the other.  A person who wants to divorce a spouse who refuses to agree to a no-fault divorce must prove that the refusing spouse is guilty of at least one fault ground.</p>
                    <p>These are the fault grounds in Mississippi.  The 5 most commonly used grounds are listed in bold:</p>

                        CHANGING THE PATH OF YOUR DIVORCE
                    </h2>
                    <p>We’ve written as if parties can only pursue 1 of the 3 paths that we’ve described.  Either:</p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-forward mr-3">
                        Negotiate all of the terms of the divorce, and then agree to a no-fault divorce;
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-forward mr-3">
                        Agree to the no-fault divorce, but take whatever issues that you can’t agree on to the judge to decide at the courthouse.  There will be a contested trial on these issues, and the judge will make a decision that is legally binding;  or
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-forward mr-3">
                        Prove that the other side is guilty of fault grounds, as part of a contested trial on all issues that you cannot agree on.  If the judge finds that you are entitled to a divorce, you will not only be granted a divorce, but at the same time the judge will divide the marital property, and make a decision about alimony.
                    </p>
                    <p>It is true that those are the only 3 paths available, but you certainly are allowed to jump from one path to another and back again (with one exception explained below).  For example, when parties can’t agree to Path 1, they generally jump to Path 3.  Then, at some point while preparing for trial, they start negotiating (maybe with a better appreciation of the other side’s case, or of the uncertainty that comes with asking a stranger [the judge] to decide their future).  Next thing you know, they jump to Path 2, and maybe even to Path 1.  This is normal. Very few cases start off as a contested, fault grounds case (i.e., Path 3), and go all the way through trial.  It happens, but what we usually see instead is people agreeing to one of the first 2 paths somewhere along the way.</p>
                    <p>Here’s the exception:  once everyone signs the Path 2 paperwork, you’re not allowed to go to Path 3.  The whole point of those papers is to tie everyone down to their agreement that the case will proceed as a no-fault divorce.  Technically, you’re allowed to ask the judge to set aside your agreement to a no-fault divorce, but you’ll have to show a good reason.</p>

                    <p>Regardless of the fault-based divorce ground, you are required to submit not only evidence that the misconduct occurred, but evidence that corroborates your primary evidence.  That’s not a great explanation, so here are some examples:</p>

                        A wife testifies that her husband gets drunk every night (primary evidence). She produces photographs of the empty beer cans and liquor bottles in his truck, and police officers testify to his arrests for DUI (corroborating evidence).

                        ADULTERY IN MISSISSIPPI
                    </h1>
                    <p>Let’s be clear what we’re talking about: sex.  Emotional Affairs might feel like adultery, and they might serve as indicators that a spouse wants to commit adultery, but without sexual consummation, an emotional affair is not adultery for purposes of divorce.</p>
                    <p>When we say sex, we mean sex during the marriage.  Even if the spouses have been separated for a long time, if they are still legally married, sex with someone else is adultery.  Even if the sex does not take place until after the parties have filed for divorce, since they’re still legally married, sex with someone else is adultery.</p>

                    <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">
                        HOW TO PROVE ADULTERY
                    </h2>
                    <p>The good news is that you do not need to catch someone in the act.  The law recognizes that due to the secretive nature of the act, it would be unfair to require proof of the guilty spouse in flagrante delicto (caught in the act).</p>
                    <p>Instead, you are required to prove that your spouse had an adulterous inclination, and also had the opportunity to satisfy that inclination.  The shorthand that lawyers use is inclination and opportunity. </p>
                    <p>Inclination can be proved by your spouse repeatedly going out with the other person, holding hands, kissing, exchanging love notes, substantial texting (particularly at all hours of the day and night), i.e., the emotional affair described above.  The proof will have to rise above the “we’re just friends” defense that we all learned in high school.  We scratch our heads at the social media posts of married people who pose with their paramour, as if their spouse will never find out, and the willingness of married people to post a profile on dating apps.</p>
                    <p>Opportunity is being with that person long enough to satisfy the inclination, and in a setting where the two have the legitimate opportunity to consummate the relationship.  Going to a hotel room or other dwelling is proof of opportunity, unless it is only for a moment, or they are with others.  Obviously, there are thousands of situations and scenarios in which this can arise, but the idea is that (a) the spouse was inclined to cheat, and (b) was in a place/situation where cheating would be likely to have occurred.</p>
                    <p>The easiest route to proving adultery is Confession, which occurs surprisingly often.  By the time spouses have decided that they are definitely getting a divorce, they often see no reason to lie about their affair. Of course, incriminating emails, voicemails, and text messages can serve as unwitting confessions of adultery.</p>
                    <p>There is nothing unusual about lawyers taking the deposition of the accused spouse and suspected paramour, to see if their stories line up.  Being put under oath, with the threat of felony perjury for telling lies, tends to make people be a little more honest about their affairs. </p>

                        DEFENSES TO ADULTERY
                    </h2>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold font-italic">" I Didn’t Do It "</p>
                    <p>The spouse accused of adultery does not have to prove innocence.  Just as in a criminal case, the defendant does not have to prove that he didn’t commit the crime, it is enough that the prosecution fails to prove that he did commit it.</p>
                    <p>Still, in either a criminal or a divorce trial, the accused will rarely offer no evidence to disprove, or at least poke holes in the other side’s case. As the accused spouse, you will want to explain why your spouse’s evidence of your adultery is not as conclusive as it might appear.</p>
                    <p>We have written a separate article on the question of whether you can invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, and refuse to answer questions about marital misconduct. You can read that article here, since the question is too complicated for a simple Yes or No answer.</p>
                    <p>That issue aside, there is a profound difference between saying, "I didn’t do it," and "My spouse hasn’t proved that I did it." The latter requires far less proof than the former. The general rule in Mississippi is that adultery is not proved if there is a reasonable explanation for why the accused spouse is innocent in spite of the accuser’s evidence.</p>
                    <p>In a famous Mississippi case decided in 2008, a wife denied ever spending the night at her alleged lover’s apartment. But a private investigator videotaped the wife and the man going into his apartment, and then spending 3 consecutive nights there.</p>
                    <p>However, the video did not show the pair being affectionate with each other (i.e., it did not show hand-holding, hugging, kissing, or other “adulterous inclination,” discussed above).  </p>
                    <p>The wife testified that she was only in the apartment because the man was ill, and she was caring for him the entire time. She denied that they had sex.  Moreover, she said that another woman was at the apartment at all times. The private investigator said that he never saw this third person entering or leaving the apartment, but admitted that he could not definitely say that nobody else had been in the apartment while it was under his surveillance.</p>
                    <p>Since the wife had an innocent explanation that was not disproved by the husband’s evidence, the Court found that the trial judge did not err in finding that the husband failed to prove adultery.  Undoubtedly, other judges considering the exact same evidence might have reached the opposite conclusion.  Nevertheless, what is interesting about the case is that the wife did not deny any of the husband’s evidence.  Instead, she provided the judge with an innocent explanation — an alibi, which the husband’s evidence did not disprove. This is the essence of the I Didn’t Do It Defense.</p>

                        Condonation — I Did It, But You Forgave Me
                    </h2>
                    <p>There is a common misconception that if you are guilty of adultery, it can’t be used against you if you can manage to get your spouse to have sex with you after the adultery took place.  This is simply wrong.</p>
                    <p>Or, to be more accurate, this is a gross distortion of the defense of Condonation.  Here’s how it actually works. The idea of condonation is forgiveness, not sex.</p>
                    <p>If your spouse knows about your adultery, and if you promise to be faithful, and if your spouse then forgives you, and if you keep your promise, then your adultery cannot be used as a fault ground against you.  Your spouse will be deemed to have forgiven — condoned — your adultery.</p>
                    <p>Note that all 4 of those conditions apply.  First, your spouse has to know about the affair. Your spouse cannot forgive/condone what they don’t know about.</p>
                    <p>Second, you have to promise that you will be faithful from now on.  There’s no point in being forgiven for something that you have no intention of stopping.</p>
                    <p>Third, your spouse has to forgive you.  This is commonly demonstrated by your spouse resuming intimate relations with you, but sex doesn’t necessarily equate with forgiveness.  Sex can indicate forgiveness, but just having sex does mean that your spouse has forgiven you.  That’s how it is in real life, and that’s how it is in the courtroom, too.</p>
                    <p>Fourth, you really do have to keep your promise.  If you are unfaithful even once after being forgiven, the law treats the forgiveness as if it never took place.  This means that not only are you guilty of the post-forgiveness adultery, but you are also guilty of the pre-forgiveness adultery (the act that you were originally forgiven for), too.</p>

                    <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">
                        Connivance — I Did It, But You Went Along With It
                    </h2>
                    <p>It sometimes happen in a marriage that an innocent spouse decides that, rather than get a divorce, it would be wiser to "look the other way." Divorces are messy, public, and can lead to a substantially diminished standard of living. When the agreement becomes explicit, whether by silence or feigned ignorance, that the guilty spouse can cheat so long as he is discreet, the innocent spouse has connived at the adultery.</p>
                    <p>There are also couples who agree to an open marriage. For example, one spouse might lose all interest in sex and agree that the other can have extra-marital relationships. In both instances, open marriage and "looking the other way," the spouses have connived at the ongoing adultery.</p>
                    <p>Connivance is a defense against the fault ground of adultery. If differs from condonation because the latter assumes repentance over and forgiveness of an illicit act in the past that will not be repeated. In contrast to condonation, connivance occurs when the parties reach an understanding that the adultery will continue.</p>

                    <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">
                        Recrimination — I Did It, But You Drove Me To It
                    </h2>
                    <p>In 1938, the Mississippi Supreme Court held that a wife whose husband "beat her unmercifully" was not entitled to a divorce. Why not? Because, according to the Court, the wife’s "vile epithets" directed at his family drove her husband to beat her.  This is the archaic defense of recrimination, or, "you drove me to do it."</p>
                    <p>Legal commentators are not sure whether recrimination is still a valid defense in Mississippi. Undoubtedly, the current Mississippi Supreme Court would have reached the opposite conclusion from that 1938 decision.</p>
                    <p>But the word recrimination appears from time to time. The basic idea is that if the accusing spouse is guilty of substantial marital misconduct, that spouse should not be awarded a divorce – particularly if their misconduct provoked the fault grounds. One court compared recrimination to the biblical idea that if you have a beam in your eye, you cannot complain about the splinter in your spouse’s eye.</p>
                    <p>A spouse pleading recrimination is not denying his adultery, nor alleging that his spouse agreed to it or forgave it. Instead, he is claiming that, because his spouse drove him to it, his adultery should not be held against him.</p>

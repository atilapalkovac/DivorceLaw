                        Child Support
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        This guide is written to explain how child support is awarded.  CLICK HERE if you want to read about how child support is modified.  Contempt of court cases and other actions to enforce child support (and other court orders) are discussed HERE.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s helpful to think of child support as 2 different financial obligations:
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        1. Cash payments (what we usually think of as child support);  and
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        2. Payment of designated expenses (such as health insurance premiums).
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        The first obligation, cash payments, is almost always calculated using a formula, which we will discuss below.  There is no formula for the second obligation, payment of expenses, so it is far more difficult to predict what a judge will order.
                    </p>

                    <p class="font-weight-bold">CASH PAYMENTS</p>
                    <p>
                        The formula for cash payments is based on the number of children being supported.  The formula is keyed to the payor’s adjusted gross income, which generally means the same thing as after-tax income.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        1. child, 14% of the payor’s after-tax income
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. children, 20% of the payor’s after-tax income
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. children, 22% of the payor’s after-tax income
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4. or more children, 24% of the payor’s after-tax income
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, if the absent parent’s monthly after-tax income is $1,000, and there is 1 child, the child support will be 14% of $1,000 — $140/month.
                    </p>

                    <p class="font-weight-bold">AFTER-TAX INCOME</p>
                    <p>
                        The law that lists the percentages that we’ve listed above does not use the term “after-tax income.”  Instead, it refers to “adjusted gross income” (AGI).  In most cases, and for most people, AGI and after-tax income means the same thing.  But not always.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here’s how judges calculate AGI.  First, add up all of the income from these sources:

                    <p>
                        Do not include the income of anyone who lives with the absent parent, such as his new wife.
                    </p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">OVERTIME</p>
                    <p>
                        Overtime is a tricky issue.  Not because there’s any question about whether it should be included in AGI (it is), but rather, in what amount?  Here are the arguments that are made every time the issue arises.  The absent parent will point out that overtime is not guaranteed, and it might go away tomorrow.  So it’s not fair to base child support on income that might not be there tomorrow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The custodial parent will answer that, yes, overtime is not guaranteed.  But neither is your job, or your income, or anything else in the future.  When the payor has a substantial history of earning overtime, it is just as unfair to base child support on no overtime, as it is to base it on overtime that might or might not be cancelled in the future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the payor can convince the judge that he only received overtime to complete a one-time project, and that he’s not going to get any overtime in the foreseeable future, the judge might leave overtime out of the AGI calculation.  Otherwise, judges often include in AGI the payor’s average overtime over the most recent year or two.  That way, periods where the payor earned zero overtime are averaged in with the periods when the payor did earn overtime.
                    </p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">DEDUCTIONS FROM AFTER-TAX INCOME</p>
                    <p>
                        Once the judge has added up all of the income from the different sources discussed above, the following must be deducted:
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">

                    <p>
                        Also, the judge is allowed, but not required, to deduct whatever he deems to be a reasonable amount for the support of children living with the absent parent.

                        What often trips people up are the items that you do not get to deduct from AGI, even though it is deducted from your paycheck, such as:

                        WHEN DO THE CHILD SUPPORT GUIDELINES NOT APPLY
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once the judge decides the absent parent’s AGI, it is a simple matter to apply the child support guidelines listed above.  But there are a few tics in the process;  the guidelines aren’t automatic.  The judge is supposed to use the guidelines, unless he has a good reason not to.  There are a number of reasons why the judge might not apply the guidelines.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        The absent parent’s AGI is more than $100,000/year.  We will talk about setting child support in high-income situations later on
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        The absent parent is paying a significant amount toward the child’s expenses
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        The absent parent is spending a great deal of time with the child, to the extent that the custodial parent’s expenses for the child are less than what they would otherwise be
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">

                    <p>
                        This is just a partial list of reasons why the judge might award an amount of child support different than what would be required by the percentage guidelines.

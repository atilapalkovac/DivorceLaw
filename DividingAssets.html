                        THE SIX STEPS FOR DIVIDING ASSETS IN DIVORCE
                        (ACTUALLY, EIGHT STEPS)
                    </h2>
                    <p>When a judge decrees a divorce, he has to divide the assets.  In a plain vanilla, garden variety case, the assets are divided up evenly — 50% to each spouse.  If you have a garden variety case, there’s not much to it.</p>
                    <p>The bad news is that many divorces are not plain vanilla cases.  Here are some examples of when a 50-50 division might not be appropriate:</p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        Some of the assets are non-marital
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        One of the spouses is guilty of significant marital fault
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        The assets were acquired solely through the efforts of one spouse, while the other made no contributions to the marriage or the family
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        One of the spouses dissipated assets (e.g., gambling, or spending money on a paramour)
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        The only significant asset cannot be effectively divided (e.g., a house, or a business)
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        The parties’ respective earnings capacities are significantly disparate
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="mb-3">
                        TWO THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND
                    </h2>
                    <p>In Mississippi, judges have to work through a process to arrive at a division of assets.  What follows is an extremely simplified discussion of how that process works.  This discussion is just the tip of the iceberg of how things actually work.  For nearly every statement made in this post, there are exceptions, caveats and outright contradictions.  It would take a long, detailed treatise to explore all of the buts and wherefores of how assets are divided in divorce.  If you want to know how assets are likely to be divided in your case, there is simply no substitute for going through your situation with a good family law attorney.  But for a thumbnail introduction into how it works, this discussion will do.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, in this discussion we are using the word “assets,” but what we really mean are assets and debts, including contingent assets/debts.  A contingent asset/debt is something that might never come into existence.  For example, if a wife is a plaintiff in a pending lawsuit, all she has is a claim.  Her claim is real enough, but whether her claim will actually ever turn into actual money is another question.  The wife has a contingent asset (the possible money from the lawsuit), while the defendant has a contingent debt (the same money that he might have to pay).</p>
                    <p>In our discussion of “assets,” we mean the entire universe of everything that is owned/owed, and which might be owned/owed.</p>

                    <p>
                        <img src="images/dividing-2.jpeg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="mb-3">
                        STEP ONE:  PICK A DATE
                    </h2>
                    <p>Once you are divorced, your assets are yours to keep.  You do not have to divide them with your former spouse.  But what about assets that you accumulate while your case is pending?  And what about assets that you accumulate after your separation, but before the lawsuit is filed?</p>
                    <p>Suppose that you have been separated from your spouse for a year, and the divorce lawsuit has been pending for several months.  Suppose also that you get a large amount of money, say, a bonus from work.  Since you are still technically married, is your spouse entitled to half of that bonus, even though you have not lived together for months?</p>
                    <p>Consider the same question from the opposite perspective. Let’s say that your spouse goes on a spending spree while the divorce is pending.  Two months ago, you had $50,000 in your joint checking account.  Now, it’s down to $12,000.  Is that spent money just gone? Or are you entitled to half of the $38,000 that your spouse spent?</p>
                    <p>One more example.  Suppose a couple in the throes of divorce has a large investment account, being managed exclusively by the husband.  A few weeks before trial, the stock market takes a nosedive and the investment account loses a third of its value.  Who gets stuck with the loss?  And imagine if the opposite happened, and instead of going down by a third, the investment account’s value went up by a third.  Who gets the gain?</p>
                    <p>It’s not enough to simply say that the judge has to divide the assets.  The judge has to divide the assets as of a particular day.  Like waves in the ocean, the total value of what a couple owns can go up and down over time.  What existed six months ago might not exist now, or if it does, might have a very different value.</p>
                    <p>So, Step One is for the judge to decide what day the assets are going to be identified, valued, and characterized.  Step One will make more sense once we’ve gone through the other Steps.</p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="images/dividing-3.jpeg" alt="" class="img-fluid">

                    <h2 class="mb-3">
                        STEP TWO:  LIST THE ASSETS
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        The next step is to list all of the assets and debts.  As we have seen, this includes contingent items.
                        It also includes items that we might not yet know the value of.  Returning to the example of where the wife filed an unresolved lawsuit for damages, while we still may not know what the value of that legal claim will prove to be, it should still be listed in the divorce.  Similarly, an ongoing business should be listed, even though the parties might not have a firm grasp of its value.
                    </p>
                    <p>There is a form used in Mississippi for listing assets and debts, known as an 8.05 form.  You can read more about the 8.05 form HERE.</p>
                    <p>How detailed should your list of assets be?  Here’s an example: It is not unusual for a party to simply list “household furnishings,” with nothing more said.  We have also seen lists of household furnishings that ran for several pages, down to the throw pillows and napkin rings.  A good rule of thumb is to list everything with a value of at least $100, and also everything that has sentimental value, even if it has no monetary value (such as family photographs, your children’s childhood mementos, Christmas ornaments, treasured souvenirs, awards, etc.).  Anything that you feel strongly should be awarded to you should be on your list.</p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Hidden Assets</p>
                    <p>From time to time, a spouse will decide to hide assets, often by putting them in the name and/or possession of a family member, business partner, or close friend. When the judge finds out, as they usually do, not only are the uncovered assets brought back into the "marital pot" to be divided, but the spouse risks losing substantial credibility with the judge. This loss of credibility affects everything; not only the recovery of the hidden asset, but every aspect of the case. Needless to say, if you are also fighting for custody of your children, or asking for (or resisting) alimony, it does not do for the judge to decide that you’re dishonest.</p>
                    <p>We point this out to say that when identifying assets, it is unwise to hide known assets.  The better practice is to list them, and then explain why they should be awarded to you.</p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Professional Degrees/Licenses</p>
                    <p>Professional degrees/licenses are not assets.  This means that the spouse of a doctor, nurse, lawyer, accountant, psychologist, etc., cannot be awarded a share of their spouse’s professional degree.  This is a bit tricky, since a professional’s business is an asset (and can be divided), and income that the professional earned is also an asset that can be divided, at least to the extent that the income has been received and has not been spent.  But the degree/license itself is not an asset that can be divided.</p>
                    <p>The typical fallback position of the spouse of a professional is to seek alimony in an amount based on the professional’s  income.   You can read more about that in our Ultimate Guide to Alimony, and in particular, about Reimbursement Alimony, for situations where one spouse put the other spouse through school. </p>

                    </p>

                    <h2 class="mb-3">
                        STEP THREE: VALUE THE ASSETS
                    </h2>
                    <p>Step Three is valuing the assets.  This is where things can get complicated, so in a moment we’ll go through the categories of assets to see how this is done.  Take note that the discussion below assumes that the parties are unable to agree on a value.  To the extent that they can agree, then they can stipulate to that value for trial and settlement purposes, and nothing more needs to be done to establish value.</p>
                    <p>A note about appraisals and appraisers.  Sometimes the only way to get an accurate value is to have the asset professionally appraised.  Professional appraisers can be expensive.  If both sides hire their own appraiser, there is a likelihood that the appraisers will arrive at different values, and it can be difficult for the judge to know which value to accept.</p>
                    <p>
                        For that reason, litigants will often agree that the court will appoint an agreed-upon appraiser, and split the cost of the appraisal.  The benefit to this arrangement is that it lessens the respective cost that each party has to bear.  Also, agreed-upon appraisals often result in agreed-upon values.
                        The downside is that it can be difficult to convince the judge to reject an agreed-upon appraisal, even if it is just plain wrong.
                    </p>
                    <p>An entirely different approach is to forego valuing an asset altogether, and simply agree to divide it, whatever its worth.  Unliquidated or contingent assets (e.g., a pending lawsuit that may or may not ever turn into actual money) are difficult to value with any certainty, so it often makes sense to say, for example, that each spouse will get 50% of the claim/asset.</p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">VALUATION OF SPECIFIC ASSETS</p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        Real Property Interests.  These can of course be professionally appraised.  However, parties can prove value by giving testimony of what they think their property is worth, and the basis of their opinion.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        Vehicles. Online databases for vehicles, including watercraft, aircraft, ATV’s, tractors, and just about anything else with an engine can provide values.  For big ticket items, it’s probably worth it to hire a professional appraiser.  Again, parties can testify about what they think their vehicles are worth.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        Financial Accounts.  This includes not only bank accounts, but investment and retirement accounts.  Valuing these accounts usually requires nothing more than an account statement from the date selected during Step One (“Pick a Date”).
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        Defined Benefit Plans.  Some examples of defined benefit plans are a public employee’s PERS account, a federal employee’s FERS account, or a railroad worker’s pension account.  Unlike 401(k) and IRA accounts, a spouse’s interest in a defined benefit plan cannot be valued merely by looking at a statement.
                    </p>
                    <p>It is usually not difficult to obtain a statement of contributions that have been made into a defined benefit plan.  But in many situations, this statement will not reflect the value of the employee’s interest in the plan.  For example, a lifetime public employee might have $120,000 in PERS contributions, but the value of the PERS account will be significantly more, especially as the spouse nears retirement age.</p>
                    <p>The bottom line is that it will often require an expert to property value an employee’s interest in a defined benefit plan.</p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        Businesses. Properly valuing a business, or a spouse’s interest in a business, is a complicated subject.  You can read the fine details here.  The “Executive Summary” version is that in Mississippi, for purposes of a divorce, a business is not valued on the basis of what the business could be sold for, or the income that it can produce.  Instead, it is valued on the basis of what it would yield after its assets were sold off, and its debts liquidated.  This is a controversial approach to valuation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        Stock Options.  Normally, stock options are valued under what is known as the “Black-Scholes model.”  There are more complicated models of valuation, such as the “Monte Carlo Simulation” method, and variations of a lattice method.  These are not details that you will need to master.  Mississippi law has not clearly delineated which of these methods (if any) should be used in divorce.  Suffice it to say that you will have to review this with your attorney and almost certainly hire a professional appraiser, particularly if the options are not in a publicly-traded company.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        Intellectual Property. Unless the asset has a fixed life and an extremely stable earning history, a professional appraisal will probably be required.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        Personal Property. After you have made a list of the household furnishings, furniture, jewelry, collections, art, firearms and ammunition, you should list the value for each item on your list.  We will discuss the concept of “measure of value” below, but the important thing to remember here is that when you are listing value, you are not listing how much you paid for the item in question, or what it would cost to replace the item.  Instead, the value to use it what you could sell it for.
                    </p>
                    <p>Most of the items in a house will only fetch “garage sale value.”  You might have paid $1,600 for your home computer, but could you even get $50 for it if you tried to sell it?  For divorce purposes, its value is $50 or less, not $1,600.  Similarly, your jewelry might be insured for $100,000, but unless you own a jewelry store, there’s a good chance that for divorce purposes, your jewelry is only worth a fraction of its insured value.</p>
                    <p>Our experience is that litigants often have wildly inaccurate opinions of the value of their furniture, art, jewelry, firearms, and so forth.  It is often worth the fairly nominal fee to have a professional appraiser value the family’s personal property.</p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        Debt (as an Asset).  If someone owes you money, that debt is an asset that should be listed, whether it is in the form of a promissory note or merely an oral promise to repay.  Note that debt owed to a spouse’s business should not be listed, since that debt will be included in the business valuation.  Any concerns that the debt will not in fact be paid should be communicated to the judge.  On the other hand, if the debt is secured, that fact should be disclosed as well.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        Debt (as an Obligation).  Loan statements, credit card statements, etc. should prove the amount of debt owed within 30 days of the date picked under Step One (“Pick a Date”).
                    </p>

                    <p class="font-weight-bold">FOUR OTHER THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT VALUATION</p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Fair Market Value</p>
                    <p>We have already touched on the notion that personal property is to be valued at “garage sale value” or “as is” value.  In other words, the wrong way to value an asset for divorce is to list it at what it originally cost, or what it would cost now to replace, or what it is insured for.</p>
                    <p>Instead, an asset should be valued at “fair market value.”  IRS Revenue Ruling 59-60 defines it as “The price at which the property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller when the former is not under any compulsion to buy, and the latter is not under any compulsion to sell, both parties having reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts.”</p>

                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Commissions and Other Costs of Sale</p>
                    <p>Real estate agents charge 5-6% commissions on the sale of a house.  There is an argument to be made that the value of the house should be reduced by this commission, particularly where the house will be sold (and the commission incurred) shortly after the divorce is completed.  Courts are split on this question.</p>

                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Taxes</p>
                    <p>Suppose one spouse has a 401(k) with a balance of $100,000, while the other has a savings account with $100,000.  Are they worth the same?  Not really, since the 401(k) can’t be accessed without paying 20% in taxes, and maybe a 10% withdrawal penalty.  Many assets have a built-in tax that springs into being once you try to turn the asset into money (think capital gains taxes).</p>

                    <p class="font-weight-bold">A Practical Note on Valuing Assets</p>
                    <p>Listing the right value for the assets of the marriage is one of the most important projects in a divorce case.  Your case is far easier to negotiate (or take to trial) once you and your lawyer have a comprehensive list of assets, and reliable evidence of the value of each item on the list.</p>
                    <p>Ideally, you will have a chart which shows all of the assets (and debts), with a value for each item on the chart, and a short description of the document which supports that value.  You can view an example of such a chart HERE.</p>
                    <p>Valuation can be a difficult, time-consuming project.  One of the easiest ways to get a good result at trial is to tackle this project in the first month or two (although that isn’t always possible).  On the other hand, one of the surest ways to leave money on the table is to take a slipshod, wait until the last minute approach to valuing assets.</p>

                    <h2 class="mb-3">
                        STEP FOUR:  CHARACTERIZE THE ASSETS
                    </h2>
                    <p>Assets are either marital property or non-marital property.  By the way, the terms “non-marital property” and “separate property” mean the same thing. The next step after valuation is to characterize all of the assets as either marital or non-marital property.</p>
                    <p>There is one critical rule to keep in mind throughout this discussion, because it colors everything.  Here’s the rule: All property on hand at the time of divorce is presumed to be marital property.  If you claim that a piece of property is non-marital property, it’s your job to prove it.  Your spouse doesn’t have to do anything at all to prove that it’s marital — it’s already presumed to be marital.  If you can’t meet your burden of proof, the judge will decide that it is marital property.</p>
                    <p>In general, property is non-marital if it is:</p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        Acquired before the marriage
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        Acquired after the date chosen in Step One
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        Acquired by gift to only one spouse (gifts to both spouses are marital property)
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        Acquired by inheritance
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        Acquired from the proceeds of non-marital property
                    </p>
                    <p>Let’s talk about that last item.</p>
                    <p>Suppose that you have $25,000 when you get married.  A few days after the marriage, you use that $25,000 to buy a car.  You didn’t acquire the car before the marriage, but you bought it with something that you did acquire before the marriage (the $25,000), so the car is non-marital property.</p>
                    <p>This example can continue on and on.  Let’s say that you sell the car for $20,000 and use the money to buy an antique desk.  Later, you swap the desk for a painting.  Later still you sell the painting and use the money to buy a CD at the bank.</p>
                    <p>
                        As long as you can show that the CD came through the painting, the desk, the car and all the way back to the original, pre-marital $25,000, the CD will be characterized as non-marital property.
                        The law uses the term “tracing” to describe the proof you use to track an asset that you own now all the way back to its non-marital source.  Bills of sale, receipts, deposit slips, contracts, and account statements are all used to prove that something you own now was ultimately funded by something you owned before as non-marital property.

                    <p class="font-weight-bold">TURNING NON-MARITAL PROPERTY INTO MARITAL PROPERTY</p>
                    <p>We now turn to one of the more controversial topics in Mississippi divorce law.  Mississippi provides 2 ways in which a spouse can turn his non-marital property into marital property, even without intending to do so.  This is controversial, because Mississippi’s laws on this subject go in a very different direction than the national trends.</p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">The Family Use Doctrine</p>
                    <p>Imagine that as a single, unmarried adult, you own a house that is fully furnished.  You marry, and over the next 20 years you have children and raise a family, all in this house.  Then your spouse files for divorce.</p>
                    <p>When you meet with your lawyer, you show him the original deed to the house from 20+ years ago.  This deed clearly shows that you are the sole owner, and that you owned the house prior to marriage.  So the house should be non-marital property, right?  Except that your lawyer says probably not.</p>
                    <p>Welcome to the Family Use Doctrine.  Generally speaking, this doctrine provides that when you allow your spouse, and especially your entire family, to use your non-marital property, you have made an implied gift of that property to the marriage (even if you never really meant to make a gift to the marriage or anyone else).  So not only is the house marital property, but so is the furniture in the house that you let your family use over the past 20 years.</p>
                    <p>What if 20 years ago you had known about the Family Use Doctrine? Maybe you would not have let your spouse (or your children) live in your house or use your things if you’d known that you would have to give half of it away if you ever got divorced.  That’s one of the criticisms of the Doctrine, that it encourages a spouse to hoard what he would otherwise share.</p>
                    <p>There are a few exceptions.  If the marriage only lasted a little while, or the property was used by the family only a little bit, the judge can find that the doctrine does not apply.  In a famous case, the court held that just because the kids rode some four-wheelers through the woods that a husband owned before the marriage, that non-marital acreage would not turn into marital property.</p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Commingling</p>
                    <p>The second way that non-marital property can turn into marital property in Mississippi is through commingling.  It is almost impossible to clearly state Mississippi’s law on this subject, but perhaps some examples will illustrate the concept.</p>
                    <p>Suppose that a wife inherits a rental property that is in terrible condition. The floor is bowed, the ceiling is falling in, the roof leaks, and there is a strange smell emanating from the central load-bearing wall. The property is in no condition to be rented, and it would never sell for anything more than the value of the dirt.</p>
                    <p>So the husband takes off from work for a few weeks to overhaul the property. He continues working on the property almost every weekend. The couple pays for the cost of materials by writing checks out of their joint account.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the property is in show condition. So the wife rents it, and deposits the monthly rent she receives into a new "rent account" which is in her sole name. She pays property taxes, insurance and other expenses associated with this property from the rent account.</p>
                    <p>Is the property marital or non-marital property? In Mississippi, the answer is not quite clear. Certainly the property was non-marital when it was acquired, since the wife inherited it. But the husband’s labor during the marriage was an "asset" of the marriage. Since he expended this "marital labor" on the house, and paid for materials from a joint account (also marital property), the now-renovated rental property was acquired through both marital and non-marital sources.</p>
                    <p>As a very general rule of thumb, the more marital time and effort (especially from the non-owning spouse), and marital money that is invested into non-marital property, the more likely that a judge will find that the non-marital property has been "commingled," and turned into marital property.</p>
                    <p>Here is another example. Suppose you have been working your entire adult life at the Jones Brick Company. The Company sponsors a 401(k) plan, and you have been contributing to that plan since you were first hired.</p>
                    <p>At age 30, you have $50,000 in your Jones Brick Company 401(k) account. Also at age 30, you meet the right person, fall in love and get married.</p>
                    <p>After the wedding and honeymoon, you continue working at Jones Brick Company, doing the same work, earning the same salary, and making the same contributions into the same 401(k) account as before. Nothing has changed, except now you are married. Every year, the Company gives you a modest raise.</p>
                    <p>Years go by, until one day you realize that you are about to get a divorce. You meet with a lawyer, who advises you to get recent statements for all of your accounts, including your 401(k). Your current statement shows that the account is now worth $132,000.</p>
                    <p>Is the $132,000 in the 401(k) account marital property or non-marital property?</p>
                    <p>One theory would be that the account is now a "mixed asset," composed of $50,000 in non-marital property, while the other $82,000 that accumulated during the marriage is marital property. There is some authority in the law to support this result.</p>
                    <p>However, there is also legal authority which would say that the $132,000 has been acquired through both non-marital resources (the original $50,000) and marital resources (the remaining $82,000). Under the "commingled" theory, because the marital and non-marital have been commingled in the same asset, the entire asset should be marital property.</p>
                    <p>If what we have said so far is not complicated enough already, we can add another level of even worse complexity. Look at our 401(k) example a little more closely. If we reviewed all of the account statements from the date of marriage until now, we would find that the $132,000 on the current statement is actually composed of 4 elements:</p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        The original $50,000 in the account
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        Earnings on this $50,000 during the marriage
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        Additional contributions to the account during the marriage. Let’s say $65,000.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        Earnings on the $65,000
                    </p>
                    <p>There is an argument to be made that not only is the original $50,000 non-marital property, but so are the earnings on that original balance. It can be a difficult chore to segregate the earnings on the original $50,000 from the earnings on the contributions made during the marriage.</p>
                    <p>Suffice it to say that where the facts point to possible commingling, it can be a time-consuming exercise to sort out the marital from the non-marital.  Your lawyer will advise you of the in’s and out’s of the process.  But remember the rule that we set out at the beginning of this Step:  All property on hand at the time of divorce is presumed to be marital.</p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Summary</p>
                    <p>Both the Family Use Doctrine and Commingling Doctrine are used to convert non-marital property into marital property. Since all property is presumed to be marital at the time of divorce, the spouse who is claiming that an asset is his non-marital property bears the burden of proving that the asset came from a non-marital source (e.g., that it was owned before the marriage, or acquired through gift or inheritance, etc.). The same spouse can expect to have the other spouse claim that even if the asset was originally non-marital property, it was converted into marital property because it was either used by the family, or else commingled with marital effort/money.</p>

                        STEP FIVE: APPLY THE FERGUSON ANALYSIS
                    </h2>
                    <p>The next step is to apply the Ferguson analysis.  “Ferguson” refers to an important case decided by the Mississippi Supreme Court in 1994, Ferguson v. Ferguson.  In that case, the Court told judges that when they divide property in divorce, they must consider what we now call the Ferguson factors.  We will list them in a moment, but they won’t make much sense without some context.</p>
                    <p>We have already outlined the first 4 steps.  If they’ve been done correctly, in most cases we will have a chart which lists the marital property (assets and debts), with values for each item listed.</p>
                    <p>In Step Six, the Judge will use this chart to make sure that he has divided all of the assets, that he has not awarded non-marital property to the wrong spouse, and that the relative distribution of value of the total amount awarded is fair to both spouses.</p>
                    <p>Fair can mean an equal, 50-50 split, but one can easily imagine a case when a 50-50 split would be decidedly unfair.  Trouble is, if you’re the Supreme Court, how can you make rules which cover every possible way in which a spouse could justify dividing assets unfairly?  It hardly seems possible to imagine every possible scenario that might be presented to a divorce judge, much less make rules in advance for how the judge should rule.  How exactly is a judge to draw the line between a fair and unfair division of assets?</p>
                    <p>In Mississippi, the answer is to address a list of issues to consider.  These are not so much questions that must be answered, as concepts that ought to be taken into account.  What are the parties’ relative contributions to create the wealth that is to be divided?  Who has already put money in their pocket (or their paramour’s pocket, or the casino’s pocket)? What about taxes?  Should alimony change the division?  The idea is that if the judge considers the “big issues,” as set forth in Ferguson, he is less likely to divide the assets unfairly.</p>
                    <p>When working with your lawyer to advocate for a particular division of assets, the important thing is to tailor the trial presentation to illustrate why a proper consideration of the Ferguson factors leads toward your recommended division, and away from your opponent’s. </p>

                    <p class="font-weight-bold">THE FERGUSON FACTORS</p>

                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-forward mr-3">
                        Substantial contribution to the accumulation of the property. Factors to be considered in determining contribution are as follows:

                        c. Contribution to the education, training or other accomplishment bearing on the earning power of the spouse accumulating the assets.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-forward mr-3">
                        The degree to which each spouse has expended, withdrawn or otherwise disposed of marital assets and any prior distribution of such assets by agreement, decree or otherwise.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-forward mr-3">
                        The market value and the emotional value of the assets subject to distribution.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-forward mr-3">
                        The value of assets not ordinarily, absent equitable factors to the contrary, subject to such distribution, such as property brought to the marriage by the parties and property acquired by inheritance or inter vivos gift by or to an individual spouse;
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-forward mr-3">
                        Tax and other economic consequences, and contractual or legal consequences to third parties, of the proposed distribution;

                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-forward mr-3">
                        The extent to which property division may, with equity to both parties, be utilized to eliminate periodic payments and other potential sources of future friction between the parties;
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-forward mr-3">
                        The needs of the parties for financial security with due regard to the combination of assets, income and earning capacity; and,

                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-forward mr-3">
                        Any other factor which in equity should be considered.
                    </p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Presumption of Equal Contribution</p>
                    <p>Look at the very first Ferguson factor, which refers to direct and indirect contributions to the acquisition of property. What does that mean?</p>
                    <p>A direct contribution is simple enough.  If you go to work, earn a paycheck, and use the money to buy something, you directly contributed to the acquisition of whatever it was that you bought.</p>
                    <p>A husband who goes to work every day, earns a salary, and is the family breadwinner is making direct contributions to the accumulation of the family’s wealth.  Does that mean that the stay-at-home mom is making no contributions?</p>
                    <p>Yes and no.  A housewife who is not earning an income is probably not making direct contributions.  But she likely is making indirect contributions, by raising the children, managing the household, and taking charge of the domestic sphere of the family which allows the husband to devote his time to his job.  He directly contributes to the wealth of the family;  she indirectly contributes to the wealth of the family.</p>
                    <p>The wife’s indirect contributions are presumed to be equivalent in value to the husband’s direct contributions.  This makes it difficult for the husband to convince the judge that the wife’s contributions have only the value of a maid, or of a nanny.</p>
                    <p>However, the presumption that “direct and indirect contributions have equal value” is not absolute.  It can be rebutted, for example, by proof that one spouse works (whether at home or at work), while the other spouse is lazy, doesn’t do anything, and isn’t making any contributions to the family, whether directly or indirectly.</p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Other Things to Consider</p>
                    <p>Up until now we have described the process of dividing assets in terms of an orderly process leading to a predictable outcome. What follows are not such much concrete rules, as general rules of thumb that are often, but not universally applied during the Ferguson analysis.</p>
                    <p>Your separate assets will not be awarded to the other side. This is a hard and fast rule, but there are a couple of caveats. One, the Judge might decide that since you will receive all of your separate property assets, then your spouse should receive substantially more of the marital property assets, as a sort of compensation for not getting any of your separate property. Two, the Judge might award alimony that you can only finance by selling off your separate property. Under both scenarios, the Judge has not given your separate property assets to your ex-, but it might feel that way.</p>
                    <p>Just because the marital property is divided equitably does not mean that it will be divided equally. In most cases, the judge begins with a 50/50 split, but there are predictable fact patterns that can influence the judge to award more than 50% to one side or the other. An (incomplete) list of those patterns would include:</p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        One spouse has significantly more financial need than the other, particularly where the problem cannot be fixed through alimony.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        Dividing assets unequally will eliminate the need to award of alimony.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        One spouse is clearly and egregiously at fault in the breakup of the marriage. The role that fault plays in the distribution of assets is unpredictable. The law in Mississippi clearly says that a judge should not punish a spouse for their adultery, substance abuse, etc. However, the law also says that "marital fault" is something that a judge should consider in dividing assets, which can mean that the fault moves the needle away from a strict 50-50 split of assets.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        A spouse has thrown money away for no good reason (such as gambling, or money spent on a paramour). The judge can award that amount from remaining assets to the innocent spouse before dividing the remaining assets.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        A spouse has done very little to benefit the marriage. By "very little," we mean not only refusing to work outside of the home, but also has not helped at home, has ignored household duties, has not helped raise the children, and so forth. The less the spouse did, the more likely the judge will award the other spouse more than 50% of the assets.  In effect, this is the opposite of the Presumption of Equal Contribution discussed above.

                        STEP SIX — DIVIDE THE ASSETS
                    </h2>
                    <p>The judge does not divide each asset. In fact, judges prefer to leave each asset whole/undivided. This is common sense. Suppose you were the judge, and the only assets to divide were 2 bank accounts, each with the exact same amount on deposit. Wouldn’t you find it simpler to give the husband one of the accounts and give the wife the other account, rather than give each spouse one-half of each account?</p>
                    <p>Of course, it’s not just bank accounts. Imagine that instead of bank accounts, the 2 assets were a house and a retirement account. Assuming they are worth the same, would it not be simpler to award the entire house to one spouse, and the entire account to the other, rather than directing the house and account be sold/liquidated and the proceeds split?</p>
                    <p>How do you physically divide assets? One way is to begin with a rough draft of the property division, in which each person receives what he already owns. The wife gets her car, the husband gets his car. The wife gets her accounts, the husband gets his accounts. The wife gets her credit cards, the husband gets his credit cards, etc. Big ticket items, such as a business owned and operated by just one spouse, will go that spouse.</p>
                    <p>Remember, this is just a rough draft – something to get us started. Once we complete it, chances are that it did not result in a 50/50 division of assets. Also, after we look at it, we might realize (for example) that it makes more sense for the wife to get one of the husband’s accounts, rather than the husband. Or the other way around. So now we take things off of the husband’s side of the ledger and add them to the wife’s side of the ledger. Or move assets from her side to his. Every now and then, we stop and see how these edits to the rough draft changes the bottom line. Are we getting closer to a 50/50 split? Or further away?</p>
                    <p>Incidentally, this is where all of the hard work getting real numbers for the asset values pays off.  It’s no good trying to divide assets in such a way that the total value that each spouse receives are equal if the values are all wrong.</p>
                    <p>So now the judge has to go back and rework his rough draft, with a few goals in mind. One is to make sure that the division of assets is practical (there's no reason to give one spouse a business that the other spouse operates), and more or less equal (assuming he intends to divide the marital estate 50/50).</p>
                    <p>At trial, both sides will offer the judge a proposed division of assets. You and your lawyer will explain why your proposed division makes more sense than your ex-‘s proposed division. There is an excellent chance that the final division actually ordered by the judge will bear no resemblance to your first, rough draft.</p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">The Equalization Payment</p>
                    <p>For reasons discussed below, there are times when the judge will divide assets in such a way that the value of one spouse’s "pile" is significantly more than the value of the other spouse’s "pile." Having done that, the judge will then order the spouse with the bigger "pile" to pay cash (either all at once, or over time) to the other spouse, so that the net result is that both receive an equal award. This cash payment is known as the equalization payment.</p>
                    <p>For example, suppose that the husband is awarded land worth $800,000, while the wife is awarded an investment account worth $200,000. Perhaps the judge could order the husband to sell $300,000's worth of land and give the proceeds to the wife. But that would require oversight of the sales process. The judge might find it less cumbersome to simply leave the property award "as is," but order the husband to give the wife a $300,000 equalization payment by a specified deadline. How the husband comes up with the $300,000 is entirely up to him. He can sell land, borrow the money, or do whatever else he wants to do to come up with the $300,000 by the court-ordered deadline.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes, equalization payments are ordered because there is no other way to fairly divide the assets. For example, if there is just one big asset – say a house or a business, the judge might prefer to order an equalization payment, rather than order the house or business sold and the proceeds divided. Another reason that the judge might order an equalization payment is because he has already determined that the receiving spouse needs cash, and that the other spouse can provide that cash. Of course, another way to provide cash is simply to award alimony.</p>

                        STEP SEVEN — CONSIDER ALIMONY
                    </h2>
                    <p>Alimony is a large enough topic to deserve its own Guide. You can read our Ultimate Guide to Alimony HERE. But we mention it here because this is the point, after the assets have been divided, that the judge will consider whether alimony should be awarded.</p>
                    <p>To be more precise, the judge will consider whether alimony should even be considered.  It may well be that the judge decides that neither party has a deficit.  If neither has a deficit, then alimony does not have to be considered.</p>
                    <p>Two key points from the Ultimate Guide to Alimony:</p>
                    <p>First, in most cases, alimony is based on need. If your -ex doesn’t need alimony (perhaps because she has significant income, or because the assets awarded to her obviate what would otherwise be a need for alimony), then the judge is unlikely to award alimony.</p>
                    <p>Second, no matter how clear-cut your need might be, judges don’t award alimony if your ex- can’t pay it. If your ex- is barely making enough money to pay his own bills, plus child support, there is not any income left from which your ex- can pay alimony. So a judge will not award alimony, even though you clearly need the money. By and large, judges are not willing to order someone to do something that they are simply unable to do.</p>

                    <h2 class="mb-3">
                        STEP EIGHT — TIDYING UP
                    </h2>
                    <p>The final step is for the judge to take a step back, look at the total financial package – property division, alimony, and child support – and decide whether the package is fair to both parties. If the overall financial award is not equitable to both parties, then this is where the judge makes the necessary adjustments to make it equitable.</p>

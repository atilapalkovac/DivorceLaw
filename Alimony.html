                    <p>Alimony is not awarded independently. It is awarded as part of a larger process, in which the marital property is identified, valued and divided. You can read about that process HERE, in our <a href="DividingAssets.html">Ultimate Guide to Dividing Assets in Divorce.</a></p>
                    <p>The very first thing you should know about alimony, the most important thing, is that judges have tremendous discretion when deciding whether to award alimony, and how much. Some states have rigid formulas that judges have to follow when calculating alimony. Mississippi does not.</p>
                    <p>Think twice about anybody who guarantees that you will receive (or that you will not have to pay) alimony. Accurately predicting what a judge is going to do on the alimony question in a particular case is one of the most difficult things that we do.</p>
                    <p>What can be predicted is a likely range of outcomes -- that is, that alimony will probably be awarded somewhere between X and Y, and that it will last for thus-and-such number of months or years. But even so, you never really know.</p>
                    <p>That being said, a judge is required to review certain categories of evidence that will be discussed within this Guide. But before diving into the details, there are some "big picture features" of alimony that you should bear in mind.</p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="images/alimony-2.jpeg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                    </p>
                    <p> We’ll say it again, because this is really important: Alimony is not awarded independently. Think of alimony as one gear in a much larger machine. Alimony is awarded, or at least considered, by the Judge as part of a larger process, in which the marital property is identified, valued, and divided. You can read about that process HERE, in our <a href="DividingAssets.html">Ultimate Guide to Dividing Assets in Divorce.</a>.</p>
                    <p>By the time in the divorce process when a judge considers whether to award alimony, several things have already happened:</p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        All of the assets have been identified and valued
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        The separate property has been segregated from the marital property
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        The separate property has been awarded to its owner.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        The marital property has been divided and awarded to the husband and wife
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        The judge has decided that even after being awarded her fair share of the marital property, one spouse (usually the wife) has a deficit, and that this deficit might be addressed by awarding alimony.
                    </p>
                    <p>We point this out, because it is easy to lose sight of the fact that alimony is awarded in the context of property division. An important point: the more property that a spouse receives in the property division, the less her need for alimony.</p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="images/alimony-3.jpeg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                    </p>
                    <p>At some point, a wife receives so much property and/or has so much income independently of alimony that she has no need for it. Think of alimony and property as opposite ends of a playground teeter-totter. The higher her share of the marital property and/or income, the lower her need for alimony.  The lower her net worth and/or income, the higher her need for alimony.</p>
                    <p>There are a few other initial points to consider. Alimony is based not only on a wife’s need to receive alimony, but also on the husband’s ability to pay alimony.  Especially in low-income situations, it is easy to prove that the wife needs alimony, but if the husband is already struggling to pay his bills, he has no income to pay alimony, so none will be ordered.</p>
                    <p>This can be heartbreaking in long-term marriages, where the husband’s income is too low to justify an alimony award, despite the wife’s obvious need.  There is nothing fair about a wife having to enter the workforce for the first time at age 60 when her husband is completely at fault in the breakup of the marriage.  But if he simply cannot possibly pay alimony, the Judge will not award it.</p>

                        5 DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF ALIMONY
                    </h2>

                    <p>Alimony is not a one-size-fits-all proposition.  There are different kinds of alimony, and each comes with its own set of rules. We’ll review those in a moment, but first let’s review the different ways that one form of alimony is different from the other:</p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        Alimony can be for a fixed, definite duration, or it can be indefinite
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        Alimony can be paid in one single payment, or it can be paid in installments, such as monthly
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        Alimony can be for a fixed, definite amount, or it can vary in amount
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        Alimony can be subject to modification by subsequent court order, or it can be non-modifiable
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        Alimony can be tax deductible, or not (this one is tricky)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="images/alimony-4.jpeg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                    </p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">1.Alimony can be for a fixed, definite duration, or it can be indefinite</p>
                    <p>Alimony can be for a specified number of payments.  For example, if a judge ordered, “12 monthly payments of $1,000 each,” there would be no more alimony after those 12 payments had been paid.</p>
                    <p>Alimony can also be indefinite, which is not the same as “forever.”  Usually, indefinite alimony will end upon the death of the recipient.  It can also end upon the recipient’s remarriage, or if she starts living with someone (we’ll discuss that later in this Guide).  </p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">
                        2.Alimony can be paid in one single payment, or it can be paid in installments, such as monthly
                    </p>
                    <p>Alimony can be due on a specific date.  For example, a “one lump sum” award might require payment of, “$50,000, due and payable on January 1, 2021.”  Under that arrangement, once the $50,000 is paid, there is no more alimony.</p>
                    <p>The more typical arrangement is for alimony to be paid in installments, usually monthly, but not always. We have seen payments due quarterly (every 3 months), semi-annually and annually.  How many payments must be paid is dependent on whether the award is definite or indefinite, as described in the previous section.</p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">
                        3. Alimony can be for a fixed, definite amount, or it can vary in amount
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you think about it, this really isn’t an aspect of alimony.  It’s more of a combination of the first 2 aspects discussed above.  You can go from one payment to any number of payments you choose (or indefinitely), payable per week, per month, per year, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As long as it is payable for a definite number of payments, you can calculate the total amount to be paid. For example, 60 monthly payments of $3,000 each is $180,000.  Monthly payments of $2,500 for 12 years is $360,000.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moreover, the amount of each payment does not have to be the same.  For example, a divorce might provide:
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        24 monthly payments of $3,000 each; then
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        24 monthly payments of $2,000 each; then
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        60 monthly payments of $1,000 each, for a total of $180,000.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where it gets tricky is if you don’t provide for a specific dollar amount, but rather a formula.  For example, the amount due could be a fixed percentage of the payor’s income, or else a fixed percentage not to exceed a specified number, or no lass than a specified number.  In most cases, using formulas is not recommended, but we’ve seen it done, such as when the payor has an extremely volatile or unpredictable income.
                    </p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">
                        4. Alimony can be subject to modification by subsequent court order or it can be non-modifiable
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nobody has a crystal ball that predicts the future with perfect accuracy.  You don’t know what the future will hold for your ex-, or for you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are receiving alimony, it might happen that your financial needs increase far more than you ever expected at the time of divorce.  In that case, you would like to go back to court and get an increase in alimony.  Wouldn’t it be nice if the divorce papers let you get a do-over, based on your new financial circumstances?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then again, your ex- could lose his job, or his business could fail, or he could go bankrupt. Wouldn’t it be nice if he could not get a do-over, based on his new circumstances?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is the crux of the modification aspect of alimony.  Shall the arrangement be that alimony cannot be modified, no matter what happens? If it is done this way, you have the security of knowing what the alimony will be, come what may.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then again, shall the arrangement be that alimony can be modified, if the award becomes completely unfair to you due to circumstances beyond your control? Suffice it to say that this arrangement is a double-edged sword, since your ex- might be the one going back to court to get a do-over.
                    </p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">5. Alimony can be tax deductible, or not</p>
                    <p>
                        This one is a little tricky, because of a change in the federal tax laws. The old rule, for divorce decrees entered before 2019, was that the person paying alimony could possibly deduct the amount of alimony that he paid from his taxable income, in which case the recipient (usually the wife) would have to include the alimony payments as taxable income, i.e., she would have to pay taxes on her alimony.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To be clear, not every divorce decree entered before 2019 had this feature of “tax-deductibility,” but at least it was possible. But then the law changed.  Under the 2017 “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,” commonly known as the Trump Tax Cut, divorce decrees entered after 2018 could not provide for tax-deductible alimony.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, to recap:  if the divorce decree was entered before 2019, alimony in that decree might be tax-deductible.  But if the divorce was entered in 2019 or later, alimony could not be tax-deductible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is a loophole, sort of. Due to some arcane rules that have to do with federal lawmaking, this aspect of the Trump Tax Cut is only in effect through 2025. Maybe this provision will be renewed, but if it is not, the phrasing of post-2018 divorce decrees might have a certain zombie aspect — meaning that even though your divorce decree is never changed, alimony that has never been tax-deductible suddenly becomes so in 2026 and thereafter.  Make sure that your lawyer is aware of this.

                        Now that we know about the different aspects of alimony, we can discuss the different kinds of alimony.  In Mississippi, there are 7 different kinds of alimony, which mix and match the 5 different aspects of alimony that we’ve just discussed:

                    <p class="font-weight-bold">1. PERMANENT, PERIODIC ALIMONY</p>
                    <p>
                        This is what people typically think of when they think of alimony.  A monthly payment that is paid until the wife dies, remarries, or cohabits with someone (we’ll talk about how cohabitation affects alimony in another section).  Permanent, periodic alimony is taxable-deductible to the payor and included in the recipient’s income (but remember, this aspect has been [temporarily] abated by the Trump Tax Cut as discussed above).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most importantly, it is modifiable.  Either party can go to court and complain that the permanent, periodic alimony is too high or too low, and ask the judge to modify or even terminate it.

                    <p class="font-weight-bold">2. LUMP SUM ALIMONY (as support)</p>
                    <p>
                        An award of this form of alimony is fairly unusual.  The general idea behind Lump Sum Alimony (as support) when it was first created in the early 1900’s was that, rather than pay alimony in monthly amounts, all of those payments can be bundled into one or more large payments, and paid all at once.  Husbands wanted the option of paying one, big payment, and then being through with paying alimony. Not all ex-husbands could afford to do this, but for those who could, it provided the option to pay off the alimony in one stroke, and be done with it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nowadays, the thinking behind Lump Sum Alimony (as support) is more pragmatic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Imagine that you are at the point in your divorce negotiations that alimony is “on the table,” and it appears that the wife is likely to be awarded some alimony, but not a lifetime award.  Let’s assume in our hypothetical that the lawyers think that she will be awarded payments for somewhere between 5 and 10 years. [Remember the very first thing that we said in this Guide:  Predicting what the judge is going to do when awarding alimony is one of the most difficult things that divorce lawyers do.]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are the wife, your concern is that the judge will only award 5 years of alimony, and you’re also concerned that, after the divorce is over, your husband might ask the judge to reduce even this.  Another concern that you might have is that your husband’s business will fail, or that he might file bankruptcy, or simply become unable to pay you even if he wanted to.  Meanwhile, the husband’s concern is that the judge will award 10 years’ worth of alimony, and that his wife will later ask the judge for even more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This fear of the unknown creates significant incentive for both parties to agree to a one-and-done payment of Lump Sum Alimony (as support).  In our example, the parties might agree that the husband will pay, say, 7 years’ worth of alimony.  This might be paid in regular, monthly amounts, or they might add up the total that he will pay over 7 years, and agree that he will pay it all at once, or within the first year.  Of course, he will demand some concessions for paying the Lump Sum Alimony (as support) now, instead of over time, but this all part of the negotiation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Judges have the authority to award Lump Sum Alimony (as support), but where we see it most often is in settlement negotiations.

                    <p class="font-weight-bold">3. LUMP SUM ALIMONY (as property division)</p>
                    <p>
                        If you’ve already read our Ultimate Guide to Dividing Assets, then you will recall that sometimes a judge will require one spouse to pay the other an Equitable Distribution Payment.  For example, let’s say that the only marital asset is the house, and the wife is going to get the house so that the parties’ children can continue to live there.  So she gets the house, the husband gets nothing, and that’s not exactly fair.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To make it fair, the judge might order the wife to pay the husband half of the equity in the house.  She still gets the house, but now he gets a cash payment.  That payment is called an Equitable Distribution Payment, but it is also sometimes called Lump Sum Alimony (as property division).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What if, in our example, the wife doesn’t have the money right now to make that payment?  The judge can order her to pay it out over time.  Or, the judge might order that she sell the house after the children have graduated, and then give the husband his payment when the house sells.  But the idea is that this payment is a fixed amount.  It’s not paid because the husband needs the money;  maybe he does, maybe he doesn’t, but that’s irrelevant.  This payment is strictly a mechanism whereby the spouse who is otherwise receiving too much in the property division has to make a payment to the other spouse in order to “even-up” the division of assets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since Lump Sum Alimony (as property division) has nothing to do with a party needing financial support, it may seem a little odd that in Mississippi it’s still called “alimony,” which most people think of as spousal support.  The terminology is a little odd to us, too, but that’s what it’s called.

                    <p class="font-weight-bold">4. REHABILITATIVE ALIMONY</p>
                    <p>
                        Imagine that you are the judge, and the parties before you are in their late 20’s or early 30’s.  They have a short-term marriage, less than 10 years.  There is not much marital property to divide;  in fact, after paying off the credit cards and selling the house that neither of them can afford after the divorce, neither will receive much more than their vehicle, and maybe a few hundred dollars in their bank accounts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Imagine further that the husband is pretty well launched on his career, but is nowhere near the income that you expect he will earn when he hits his stride in his 40’s and 50’s.  In the meantime, the wife has little or no income, perhaps because she has stayed home to raise the parties’ young children.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since this is a short-term marriage, and the parties are both relatively young, your inclination is against awarding permanent, periodic alimony.  That’s too much.  Your inclination is also against awarding no alimony.  That’s too little.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What you would like to do is award alimony, but only for a few years — just long enough so that the wife can get on her feet and become self-supporting.  Chances are, you would award rehabilitative alimony.  It’s just what it sounds like:  alimony awarded so that the recipient can rehabilitate her ability to support herself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rehabilitative alimony awards might be similar to permanent, periodic alimony awards in amount, but not in duration.  While permanent, periodic alimony lasts until the recipient’s death or remarriage, we’ve seen awards of rehabilitative alimony that were as brief as 6 months.  It’s unusual for them to last as long as 5 years.  Again, the idea is an award of alimony that is big enough, and is paid for long enough, for the recipient to become self-supporting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We’re also noticing another trend in rehabilitative alimony.  In cases where the ex-wife is already self-supporting, there’s no need for rehabilitation.  Nevertheless, judges who want to award some alimony, for a few years but not permanently, are starting to award rehabilitative alimony.  We’re not sure whether the trend will continue, and there is some legal authority for the proposition that if the alimony recipient is already self-supporting, a judge should not award this form of alimony.  Stay tuned.

                    <p>

                    <p class="font-weight-bold">5. REIMBURSEMENT ALIMONY</p>
                    <p>
                        The idea behind reimbursement alimony occurs so infrequently that we don’t often see it.  But it does come up from time to time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Imagine that a couple gets married right after high school.  The husband goes to college;  the wife goes to work.  Her income pays the bills.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4 years later, the husband graduates and starts medical school.  Same deal:  he studies, the wife goes to work, and her income pays the bills.  Then Residency, and the same deal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Not long after the husband finally becomes a doctor and is earning six figures, he decides that he wants a divorce.  The wife sees a lawyer, who does some research and finds that no marital property has accumulated, so she’s not going to get much from the division of assets.  [As we noted in our Ultimate Guide to Dividing Assets, in Mississippi a professional degree/license is not an asset that the divorce court can divide.]  Also, since the wife already has a job, is self-supporting and is still young, her husband’s lawyer is going to argue that she’s not entitled to alimony.  And even if she did get permanent, periodic alimony, it stops whenever you remarries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is the situation that Reimbursement Alimony was intended to address.  The idea is to reimburse the supporting spouse, who has postponed present consumption and a higher standard of living, in the hope of a better life — one that she won’t receive because of the divorce.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This form of alimony has not received widespread attention in Mississippi, so the rules of how it works are still unclear.  One national conference of divorce attorneys reported that reimbursement alimony should operate more or less the way that Lump Sum Alimony (as property division) works, i.e., that the award is a fixed amount, payable either in one lump sum or in installments, and that the supporting spouse’s subsequent remarriage (or death) will not relieve the professional spouse of having to pay.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If that’s the case, here’s how Reimbursement Alimony stacks up with the 5 aspects of alimony:

                        Is it tax-deductible? No.
                    </p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">6. PAYMENT OF DESIGNATED EXPENSES</p>
                    <p>
                        People usually think of alimony as a monthly check that the ex-husband writes to his ex-wife.  Although the purpose of the check is for the ex-wife’s support, she is free to spend the alimony money any way that she chooses.  She can gamble it away, she can buy a piece of art, she can do whatever she wants.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here’s another idea:  sometimes, a judge decides that the wife needs alimony, but only for a specific purpose — to meet a particular financial need (such as to pay for college tuition) or to pay a debt (such as a mortgage).  If the wife is awarded, say, $3,500/month in alimony, it might not be apparent at trial how many monthly payments will be necessary to pay for whatever the judge had in mind.  For example, how many monthly payments will the wife need to get her teacher’s certificate and relocate to whatever school district she takes a job with?  There’s really no way to know for sure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Judges have the option of ordering payment of a particular expense rather than payment of a monthly check.  For example, the judge might order that once the children graduate, the house is to be put up for sale and when it sells, the sales proceeds are to be evenly divided between the husband and wife.  But in the meantime, until the house is sold, the husband is ordered to pay the mortgage payments and the utilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We’re not talking about the children’s expenses.  That’s a separate matter, which we address in our Ultimate Guide to Child Support.  You can read that HERE.  Even if there are no children, a judge can order payment of expenses.
                    </p>

                    <p class="font-weight-bold">7. HYBRID ALIMONY</p>
                    <p>
                        Each of the 6 forms of alimony that we have listed above is something that a judge can award after a divorce trial.  These are forms established in divorce law, with defined characteristics (or as we have called them, aspects).  Here are those 5 aspects again:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alimony can be for a fixed, definite duration, or it can be indefinite
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        Alimony can be paid in one single payment, or it can be paid in installments, such as monthly
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        Alimony can be for a fixed, definite amount, or it can vary in amount
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        Alimony can be subject to modification by subsequent court order, or it can be non-modifiable
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        Alimony can be tax deductible, or not
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But what if you wanted to mix and match different aspects?  For example, you and your spouse like the idea that alimony should not be modifiable — whatever you agree to, you both want that to be it.  End of story.  So that suggests Lump Sum Alimony (as support).  But suppose you also agree that the alimony should be indefinite — “payable until the wife dies or remarries?”  Of the 6 forms of alimony that we’ve described, not one of them has the aspect of “not modifiable” and also “indefinite.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Can you customize your own alimony award, so that it has the aspects that you and your spouse agree to?  In almost all situations, you can.  When you customize your own form of alimony, the result is called Hybrid Alimony.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The ability to create Hybrid Alimony is a significant advantage of negotiating a settlement of your divorce.  If you take the divorce to trial and the judge makes the decision to award alimony, he can only choose one of the 6 forms listed above.  But if you negotiate a settlement, you can mix and match the aspects of alimony that are right for you and create your own version of Hybrid Alimony.
                    </p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">MULTIPLE FORMS OF ALIMONY IN ONE DIVORCE</p>
                    <p>
                        One last point, an important one, before we wrap up this section about the 7 Forms of Alimony.  Can a judge award more than one form of alimony in the same divorce?  For example, can he award permanent, periodic alimony AND payment of expenses AND Lump Sum Alimony (as support)?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The answer is yes.  But remember, a judge will NEVER award any alimony that is beyond the husband’s ability to pay, and in most cases that a judge sees, the husband does not have the ability to pay a single dollar of alimony.  So, although theoretically he has in his judicial toolkit the ability to award more than one form of alimony, that certainly doesn’t mean that in reality he is likely to do it.

                    <p class="font-weight-bolder">HOW MUCH ALIMONY IS AWARDED</p>
                    <p>This is probably the section that we should have put at the top, since this is the question we’re always asked.  How much alimony can I get? —or, How much alimony am I going to have to pay?</p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Alimony for Support vs. Alimony to Transfer Assets</p>
                    <p>
                        There are 2 basic reasons that alimony is awarded in Mississippi:
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        To support the wife (i.e., to help her meet her financial needs);  and
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        To transfer assets to the wife (i.e., she might not even need the money).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first reason is self-explanatory.  The second reason isn’t so much “alimony,” (although that’s the term we use), as it is a distribution of property.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Recall that one example of using alimony to distribute property is where the only asset of any considerable size is the husband’s business.  If you don’t want to order him to sell the business (and why would you), then the judge might award 100% of the business to the husband, but then order him to pay Lump Sum Alimony (as property division) in the amount of 50% of the value of the business.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="font-weight-bold">It doesn’t matter whether the wife needs the money or not.</span>  The purpose isn’t to provide for her support;  the purpose is to transfer assets from one spouse to the other, in this case so that each spouse will receive an amount equal to 50% of the whole.  Reimbursement Alimony, which we described in a previous section (e.g., the wife put the husband through professional school and then he divorced her), is another example of when the purpose of alimony is to transfer assets rather than to help meet the recipient-spouse’s financial needs.</p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">When the Purpose of Alimony is to Distribute Property </p>
                    <p>
                        Here’s a very brief aside and then we’ll ignore it:  judges don’t have to divide the marital estate 50-50.  They can award one spouse 55% or 60% or even more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        OK, now that we’ve gotten that idea out of the way, let’s assume for the rest of this discussion that the judge has decided to divide assets 50-50.  That’s how they usually do it.  If the purpose of the alimony award is to distribute property, then it’s pretty easy to calculate how much the alimony is going to be:  whatever it takes to get to 50-50.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here’s a simple example. Suppose there are only 2 assets to divide:
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        $5,000 shotgun
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        $25,000 painting
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There’s really no way to divide those 2 assets evenly.  Either each spouse gets one asset, or else one spouse gets both assets, while the other gets neither.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If one spouse gets the painting and the other gets the shotgun, then the spouse with the painting has to pay $10,000 to the other spouse to make the division come out even.  That payment can be termed Lump Sum Alimony (as property division).  Obviously, the amount of the award is whatever is needed to make the property division come out right.
                    </p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold" ">When the Purpose of Alimony is to Support the Recipient</p>
                    <p>
                        Here’s how alimony is calculated when the idea is to support the recipient spouse.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="icon-question font-weight-bold"> Can the husband afford to pay any alimony?</span>  If the husband can barely meet his own reasonable needs, and isn’t intentionally earning less than he is reasonably capable of earning, then, by definition, he lacks the ability to pay alimony.  A husband will not be ordered to pay what he cannot pay, even if the wife is in desperate need of alimony.  Frankly, this is the situation that judges face day in and day out — parties whose legitimate expenses far outstrip their ability to pay those expenses.  [If the husband is intentionally earning less than he is capable of earning, then answer this question according to his earning capacity rather than his earnings.]
                        If the answer to this question is NO, then stop here.  If yes…
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="icon-question font-weight-bold"> Does the wife need alimony?</span>  Taking into account the wife’s income, her earnings capacity, and the assets that she already has (including what she received in the division of marital property), does she still need alimony?  Of course, need is a relative term.  Generally speaking, need in a short-term marriage is understood to mean the amount necessary to avoid destitution.  Need in a long-term marriage is generally understood to mean the amount necessary to maintain the lifestyle to which the wife has become accustomed.  The concept of need is incredibly fluid;  everyone defines need differently.  It’s the judge’s definition that counts, so, Does the Judge think that the wife needs alimony?  If the answer to this question is NO, then stop here.  If yes…
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="icon-question font-weight-bold">
                            How does the husband’s ability to afford alimony compare with the wife’s need for alimony?
                        </span>
                        This is where the rubber meets the road.  Count on the wife’s attorney to point out that, even after paying all of his reasonable bills, he still has enough income “left over” that he can afford to pay alimony.  If the husband earns $12,000/month, and his bills only add up to $7,000/month, shouldn’t he have to pay $5,000/month in alimony?
                        Naturally, the husband’s attorney will point out that his client doesn’t earn $12,000, he earns $10,000;  and his bills aren’t $7,000, they’re $9,000;  and the wife can earn enough to cover all of her bills anyway, which (he’ll say) are vastly inflated.
                        <span class="font-weight-bold">
                            This is the dance where both sides argue whether the husband has “excess income”
                        </span>
                        (his income and earnings capacity exceed his bills),
                        <span class="font-weight-bold">
                            whether the wife has “excess need”
                        </span>
                        (her reasonable bills exceed her income and earnings capacity),
                        <span class="font-weight-bold">
                            does the asset division alleviate “need,”
                        </span>
                        and
                        <span class="font-weight-bold">
                            what part other factors play
                        </span>
                        (e.g., who caused the breakup of the marriage, was this a short, medium, or long-term marriage, how old are the spouses, etc.).
                    </p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">The Effect on Social Security on Alimony</p>
                    <p>
                        When the recipient begins drawing Social Security, she has an option on how the amount of Social Security payment should be calculated.  (1) She can base the calculation on her earnings history;  or (2) if she was married to her husband for at least 10 years and has not remarried, she has the option of basing her Social Security on his earnings history — but she only gets 50% of the resulting Social Security benefit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under either option, the husband’s Social Security benefit is not affected in the slightest.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Recent appellate cases have suggested that if the husband chooses this second option, then the husband can reduce his alimony obligation by the amount that the wife receives in Social Security.  Similarly, if a wife receives a benefit from the Husband’s SSDI, his alimony obligation can likewise be reduced.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But the reduction is not automatic.  The husband still must apply to the court to effectuate this reduction.  In other words, the husband cannot simply reduce the amount of his alimony check without first obtaining court approval.

                    So far, we haven’t given you any numbers or formulas that you can use to calculate the likely alimony award in your case.  That’s because there aren’t any formulas.  Your judge doesn’t have a formula, either.  But the analysis outline in the previous section, where the wife’s needs are compared against the husband’s ability to meet those needs, is where the judge will start.

                        He is required to engage in a more in-depth analysis of 12 factors, which are called the Armstrong Factors, after a Supreme Court case (Armstrong v. Armstrong) which listed the factors for the first time.  Here they are:

                    <p>
                        We’ve covered most of these already, but let’s take a look at a few items more closely.
                    </p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Earnings Capacity</p>
                    <p>This comes into play in a couple of different ways.  Judges often notice how a husband will have years of record earnings, only to report that his income tanked in the year before the divorce.  How much the husband can really earn is often a bone of contention.  Second, where the wife has not worked outside of the home for years, it’s not unusual for vocational experts to testify on the subject of (1) how much she could earn if she re-entered the workforce today;  and (2) how much she could earn if she got a degree, a professional license or some other training to increase her earnings capacity.  The Big Idea, of course, is to argue that even if the wife’s earnings are low now, in a few years the wife is capable of earning enough that she won’t need any financial support from her ex-husband.</p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Length of Marriage</p>
                    <p>
                        Generally speaking, the longer the marriage, the more likely the judge is to award substantial alimony.  One expert on the subject calculated that if the marriage lasts at least 20 years, the likelihood of an award of permanent, periodic alimony increases substantially;  but if it lasts less than 10 years, the same award is highly unlikely.
                        Your Results May Vary.
                    </p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Minor Children</p>
                    <p>In deciding whether to award alimony, the judge is supposed to take into account any award of child support that he has made.  You can read more about child support awards in our Ultimate Guide to Child Support.  The point we are making here is that when the wife is raising the children post-divorce, the judge will consider the overall financial package (kids’ expenses and child support included) when trying to calculate alimony.</p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Standard of Living</p>
                    <p>
                        This, and the related concept of need, are the most idiosyncratic issues that a judge will consider, which is a key reason why predicting a judge’s alimony award is so difficult.  There are people in Mississippi living on far less than $20,000/year, so how much do you really need?  Do you need to upgrade from mobile home to apartment to rent house to house ownership to dream house?  We can follow the same spectrum from a $3,000 used car to a brand new luxury SUV.  How nice of a car do you really need?
                        This is where the idea of Standard of Living is so helpful.  If the parties have been living in a dream house and bought new cars every few years, it’s going to be hard to convince the judge that either of them should, post-divorce, have to live in an apartment and drive a car with 300,000 miles on it.  Yes, people do live in apartments and drive old cars, but in this case, that’s not the parties’ standard of living.  The point is, to the extent that resources allow, judges generally try to make their awards so that each party can maintain approximately the same standard of living as before the divorce.

                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Marital Fault or Misconduct</p>
                    <p>
                        This is a tricky issue.  Judges are instructed to avoid using alimony to punish a spouse who is guilty of marital fault or misconduct.  But they are allowed to take marital fault into account.  We’re not sure how to do one without the other, but that’s what the law says.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The law books also say that a spouse who is guilty of adultery is not to receive alimony, except to the extent necessary to avoid destitution.  That prohibition may not be as sweeping as it sounds, since most parties agree to a divorce on the basis of Irreconcilable Differences (no-fault), even if one spouse has committed adultery.  You can read more about that in our <a href="DividingAssets.html">Ultimate Guide to Dividing Assets in Divorce.</a><a href="Divorce.html"></a>.

                        <span class="font-weight-bold">We’ve had any number of conversations with innocent spouses who were convinced that the judge was going to give them anything they wanted because of what the guilty spouse did.</span>  Our experience is that judges are far more circumspect, especially where the evidence is less than clear, and the misconduct is no more egregious than what the judge is used to seeing in the courtroom.
                    </p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Dissipation of Assets</p>
                    <p>
                        Dissipation of Assets refers to a spouse using marital assets in a way that the judge does not approve of.    The classic examples are spending on a mistress and significant gambling.

                        Where one spouse has dissipated significant marital assets, the judge is far less likely to relieve him of the alimony obligations that would otherwise be imposed if the assets were still unspent.  In other words, a husband cannot spend money on mistresses and riverboats and then expect the judge to reduce his alimony obligation because he doesn’t have the money any more.

                    <p>Different forms of alimony have different endings.</p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3 font-weight-bold">Permanent, periodic alimony</span>ends upon the death or the remarriage of the recipient.  It can also end upon the recipient entering into a romantic relationship;  we’ll talk about that a bit more in a moment.  Permanent, periodic alimony also ends upon the death of the payor (i.e., his estate is not responsible to continue making payments after his death).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3 font-weight-bold">Lump sum alimony (as support)</span> ends when the full amount due has been paid.

                        <span class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3 font-weight-bold">Lump sum alimony (as property division)</span> also ends when the full amount due has been paid.

                        <span class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3 font-weight-bold">Rehabilitative alimony</span> ends at the conclusion of the time period it has been awarded.  In other words, when it is awarded, the divorce decree will say that it is payable for thus-and-such number of months or years.  When that time period has concluded, rehabilitative alimony ends.  However, if the recipient dies or remarries (or enters into a romantic relationship as discussed below) prior to the end of the time period, then the rehabilitative alimony ends when that event occurs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3 font-weight-bold">Reimbursement alimony</span> ends when the full amount due has been paid.
                    </p>

                        <span class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3 font-weight-bold">Payment of designated expenses</span> ends when the decree provides.  This is a tricky one.

                        <span class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3 font-weight-bold">Hybrid alimony</span> ends whenever the divorce decree says that it ends.  Remember that hybrid alimony is a creature created by the parties during their negotiated divorce settlement.

                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Romantic Relationships and the De Facto Marriage</p>
                    <p>
                        As we have discussed, some forms of alimony automatically terminate upon the recipient’s remarriage.  Naturally, some recipients decide to not remarry precisely so that their alimony will continue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But what happens when the recipient, while not exactly remarrying, enters into a romantic relationship that is about as close to a marriage as it can be, except without the formal exchange of wedding vows?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the recipient is clearly in a relationship, and the evidence is clear and direct that she is avoiding remarriage solely to continue receiving alimony, the ex-husband can apply to the court to find that she is in a de facto marriage, and terminate her alimony.  This can be tougher to prove than it sounds.  In one case, the ex-wife wore her boyfriend’s diamond ring, traveled with him and they spent the night together for a week or more at a time, and yet the court held that she was not in a de facto marriage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cohabitation with a romantic partner can also trigger a termination of alimony.  It is not enough that the ex-husband prove that the lovers are in a sexual relationship.  Their relationship must also be one of mutual support which alters the ex-wife’s financial needs.  The judge is entitled to presume that such a relationship exists if the lovers are cohabiting.  Note that “cohabiting” means more than living together on weekends or a few nights each week.
                    </p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Discharging Alimony Obligations in Bankruptcy Court</p>
                    <p>
                        Can alimony obligations be discharged in bankruptcy?  We don’t practice bankruptcy law, so the fine details of how this works is a question we’ll leave to the experts in that field.  But, generally speaking, alimony is or is not dischargeable, depending on the purpose of the alimony.  If the alimony was intended for the support of the spouse, it qualifies as a “domestic support obligation” (which is the term used in bankruptcy court).  Child support and alimony that is intended to support the (former) spouse are domestic support obligations, which cannot be discharged in bankruptcy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the other hand, if the purpose of the alimony was to aid in the distribution of assets, then it is generally not considered to be a “domestic support obligation,” and it is dischargeable.  But there are tricks and traps that attend this maneuver.
                    </p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Modification of Alimony</p>
                    <p>
                        As we mentioned earlier, some forms of alimony are modifiable.  By modifiable, we mean that sometime after the divorce has been finalized, a party can ask the judge to increase, decrease or terminate the alimony award.  The forms of alimony that can be modified are:
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        Permanent, periodic alimony
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        Rehabilitative alimony
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        Payment of designated expenses (if the divorce decree is written in such a way to include this possibility)
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        Hybrid alimony (again, if the divorce decree is written to allow subsequent modifications)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If it is important to you that the alimony not be modifiable, then be sure that your negotiations proceed accordingly.  But remember that whether you are the payor or the recipient, there are unknown possibilities out there which might make modifiability a good option for you.  This is something that you will want to carefully discuss with your lawyer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So when can modifiable alimony be modified?  There are three general rules:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (1) it can be modified if there has been a clear and substantial change in circumstances of either (former) spouse;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (2) a payor cannot premise his modification request on his voluntarily worsening his financial picture (i.e., quitting his job, incurring new debt, starting a second family);
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (3) if there has been a clear and substantial change in circumstances, the judge will look at both parties’ new (i.e., as of the time of the modification trial) financial status.  If the parties’ relative financial position is more or less the same, alimony will not be modified.  The judge will review the Armstrong factors discussed above in the modification trial.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are a few what-if scenarios that often come up in alimony modification cases.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        What if the original divorce decree did not provide for alimony? Can you later go to court and ask the judge to modify the decree so that it now provides for alimony? No.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        What if, instead of going to court to modify alimony, we just agree to change the alimony obligations.  Will that out-of-court arrangement hold up at the courthouse? Probably not.  Especially if you are the payor, it is a terrible mistake to not have a lawyer draw up the papers to make your agreement official.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ion-ios-arrow-dropright-circle mr-3">
                        What if we agree to a new arrangement which forgives alimony that accrued, but the payor never paid.  Is that legal? No.  Generally speaking, agreements to waive past due, unpaid alimony are not enforceable in court.  Same rule for unpaid, past due child support.
